This is Roy, as a software developer, I'm working in the finance domain for more than 7 years. When I write down this page, I hope to acheive serveral things:
1. Record some ideas about the software engineering for me and for sharing;
2. Work as a notebook to track all the history of my career;
3. Improve my written & spoken English;
